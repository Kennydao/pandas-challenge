# pandas-challenge

Pandas is an open-source Python library, providing powerful tools for data manipulation and analytics. 
In this assignment, I have utilized Pandas to manipulate, process, model the give dataset (students dataset and schools dataset) 
to generate meaningful statistic, reports, details analysis from district overview such as total school budgets, budget per student, 
average performing scores in math and reading, percentage of students with passing rate and performance by schools size, 
type (charter or district) and narrowing to actual performance, KPIs by individual school and grade levels. 
Below is the brief findings based on the given dataset.

District Summary: There are total 39,170 students across 15 schools in the district with total annual budgets of $24.6M. 
In this current year, the average math and reading score are 80 and 82 with passing rate of 75% and 86% respectively, 
which represents 80.4% of overall passing rate.

School Summary: This report provides a quick view on budgets allocated by schools with details information relating to 
number of students, budgets spending per student, average math and reading score as well as overall passing rate at the school.

Top Performing Schools (by % overall passing):
	A) Top Five Performing Schools by % overall passing rate are as follows:
		1)	Cabrera High School
		2)	Thomas High School
		3)	Pena High School
		4)	Griffin High School
		5)	Wilson High School
	B) Bottom Five Performing Schools by % overall passing rate are as follows:
		1)	Hernandez High School
		2)	Johnson High School
		3)	Huang High School
		4)	Figueroa High School
		5)	Rodriguez High School

Math and Reading Score by Grade: The two tables list down the average math and reading score by grades (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th)
at each individual school.

Score by School Spending: The analysis shows that schools with Spending Range (Per Student) between $585-$629 has highest overall 
passing rate.

Scores by School Size: Small (<1,000 students) and Medium (1,000 – 2,000 students) schools in the district perform better than 
the larger scale schools (2,000-5,000 students) as Small and Medium school’s overall passing rate are 94.82% and 95.19% vs 76.37% (Large schools).

Scores by School Type: Charter schools have higher overall passing rate than district schools (95.1% vs 73.68%).
